# Development of a System for Classification Russian Dialectal Speech
Master's Thesis, Ekaterina Zalivina

This work is an analysis of approaches to identifying dialects of the Russian language using text and audio data. The text was classified using the support vector machine, based on n-grams and TF-IDF features, we also use BERT classifier pre-trained on Russian texts. The audio was also classified using a support vector machine with MFCC features. Additionally, a Whisper model was used for audio classification. Audio features include both linguistic and non-linguistic information, such as recording conditions and noise. The main task of this study was to develop a robust model that can handle various recording conditions using a small amount of data. To achieve this, methods such as freezing encoder layers, augmenting noisy data, and combining multiple models were explored. The research showed that the best results were achieved using a multimodal model that combined ruBERT and Whisper encoder layers. This model proved to be more robust to data that was not included in the dataset.
